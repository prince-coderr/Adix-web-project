          <p>
            I was born on <strong>May 22, 2004</strong>, in <strong>, Nairobi</strong>, and I‚Äôve been curious about tech ever since I could reach a keyboard. I grew up wondering how things worked‚Äîwhy websites looked the way they did, how apps connected people, and what it would take to build something that truly helps others. That wonder never left.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            I started school in <strong>Murang‚Äôa County</strong> <!--and later joined <strong>Nyagatugu School</strong>-->, where my love for tech really took root. I was <em>that kid</em> in the computer lab after class, clicking around, learning things online, and trying to build stuff that probably didn‚Äôt work... yet.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Fast forward a bit‚ÄîI joined <strong>Equip Africa Institute, a TVET under (MKU)</strong> to study <strong>Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</strong>, and that‚Äôs where things really kicked off. While at MKU, I saw how many young people and businesses were struggling to find the right tech tools or digital guidance. I knew I could do something about it.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            That‚Äôs how <strong>Adix Tech</strong> was born.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            I started with a simple idea: make tech more accessible, more powerful, and more tailored for the people around me. What began as just me and a laptop has grown into a digital hub offering web development, creative solutions, tech tips, and resources designed to uplift African creators and entrepreneurs.

                    At the core of everything I do is a desire to make a meaningful impact,not just in the tech space, but in the lives of people around me.

                <p>
                    I believe that technology should do more than just look good or run fast,it should solve real problems. Whether it's helping a small business go digital, creating a platform that connects communities, or teaching someone their first lines of code, I want my work to be part of something bigger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm passionate about using my skills to contribute to solutions that matter,especially for African youth, creators, and entrepreneurs who deserve better access to digital tools and opportunities.
                </p>

                <p>
